# Multi-Language Text Detection System

# Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the Multi-Language Text Detection System.
The system is designed to detect piracy-related keywords from non-English text inputs. It uses a combination of translation models and natural language processing techniques to achieve this.
Key features of this project include:

Translating non-English text to English using Hugging Face Transformers.
Identifying piracy-related keywords using spaCy.
This project has applications in industries like media, entertainment, and cybersecurity for combating piracy effectively.

# Requirements
Python Version
Python 3.7+
Python Packages
Flask
transformers
torch
langdetect
spacy

# Additional Tools (optional)
Hugging Face translation models: To perform language translation.

# Install these libraries using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Enter non-English text, click "Detect", and view the results.

# Future Enhancements
Extend keyword detection to include more context-aware piracy identifiers.
Add support for detecting text from uploaded files (e.g., PDFs, images with OCR).
Include additional languages for keyword detection directly.
